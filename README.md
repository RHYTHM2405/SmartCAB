SmartCAB is an intelligent cab allocation system designed to optimize the allocation of cabs to trips, enhance user experience for employees searching for cabs, and integrate real-time location data for accuracy in suggestions. This project demonstrates robust authentication, efficient data management, and fault-tolerant mechanisms to provide a reliable and scalable solution.


Features:

Authentication: Robust user authentication to ensure secure access.
Cab Allocation: Optimizes cab allocation based on proximity to trip start locations.
Real-Time Location Integration: Seamless integration of real-time location data for accuracy.
System Monitoring: Comprehensive monitoring tools for performance tracking.
Caching: Efficient caching mechanisms to improve response times.
Error Handling: Robust error and exception handling framework.
