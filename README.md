Smart Cab Allocation System for Efficient Trip Planning


SmartCAB is an intelligent cab allocation system designed to optimize the allocation of cabs to trips, enhance user experience for employees searching for cabs, and integrate real-time location data for accuracy in suggestions. This project demonstrates robust authentication, efficient data management, and fault-tolerant mechanisms to provide a reliable and scalable solution.


Features:

Authentication: Robust user authentication to ensure secure access.
Cab Allocation: Optimizes cab allocation based on proximity to trip start locations.
Real-Time Location Integration: Seamless integration of real-time location data for accuracy.
System Monitoring: Comprehensive monitoring tools for performance tracking.
Caching: Efficient caching mechanisms to improve response times.
Error Handling: Robust error and exception handling framework.
